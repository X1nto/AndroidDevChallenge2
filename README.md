# Simple Compose Timer

![Workflow result](https://github.com/X1nto/SimpleComposeTimer/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## :scroll: Description
A simple timer app, which does exactly what you tell it to do - sets a timer.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
While the UI might be a bit different from what you'd expect from a timer app, I believe the approach I used (OutlinedTextFields for input) makes the app look unique.
I also liked the `weight` attribute of the Modifier interface, which made it possible to have text fields of the same size.

Additionally, I wanted to add a stop button for the timer, but because of weird NPEs I scrapped out the idea :grin:
